<h1 align="center">Hand-on Tutorial: Introduction to Git and GitHub </h1>

This tutorial provides an introduction to version control systems using `git` and `GitHub`. It focuses on teaching you the techniques you need to actually get started.

We will use the ⌨️ Command Line Interface (CLI) (i.e. `Bash` for Windows and `Terminal` in Mac) to perform essential command line techniques. No-one is giving out any nerd points 🤓🏆 for struggling through the CLI for the sake of it.
