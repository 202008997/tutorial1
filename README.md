<h1 align="center">Hand-on Tutorial: Introduction to Git and GitHub </h1>

This tutorial provides an introduction to version control systems using `git` and `GitHub`. It focuses on teaching you the techniques you need to actually get started.

We will use the ⌨️ Command Line Interface (CLI) (i.e. `Bash` for Windows and `Terminal` in Mac) to perform essential command line techniques. 

## To Get Started

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).

3. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). 

    - Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    - Mac users: [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) or install it using Homebrew: 

        ```
        brew install git
        ```

    
4. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line with your name and email address:

    ```bash
          $ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
          $ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    ```
This is important because Git will use this information when you work on a project.
